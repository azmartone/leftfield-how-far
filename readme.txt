The following tasks are designed to see how you approach solving problems with code, as well as how you organize your code.  For these reasons, please note the following guidelines:


Using JQuery is ok, but try to minimize your reliance on other libraries or plugins.  The fewer external dependencies your code has, the more we’re able to see how you think in code and will give us a better idea of your coding style.
Treat the code you write here as you would code you’re writing on a project with other people on it.  Where necessary to comment on something to indicate your reasoning or make the code more amenable to reuse, please do!
Send code either via a zip file w/ all of the files necessary to run the example or as a GitHub repo (preferable).

1.  Given the following list of places, use JS to produce a script that orders the locations by distance to the LFL office (510 Victoria, Venice, CA).  You may use whatever geocoding service you’d like, but you will probably find most luck using Google Maps' Geocoding API.

Places:

Bonus points if you’d like to try:
a visualization of this data in the DOM
abstracting out the script to take user-supplied input to order the locations by distance to any user-supplied location
