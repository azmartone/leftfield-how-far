# How many cups?	

This is a visualization of how many cups you can put side to side from Left Fields Labs to reach a certain destination.

## Configuration
Origin and Destinations are configured in the data.js file.

## Notes
    * Chart visualization scales according to window width
    * The distance represents the "as a crow flys" distance and not the travel distance.
    * haversine formula borrowed from http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html
